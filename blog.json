Its time to focus once again, time to give everything that i got, I don't hope any longer I just want to work for it, this blog will mark a definitve absence of mine from the rest of the world till i find my way through Computer Science as thats what I only have left."

During the first 2 years I was into lower level coding and was officially maintaining Android projects mainly Custom Android sources like DotOS, SuperiorOS, Liquid Remix, ViperOS, then as my interest shifted I got introduced to web development from various subreddits i used to follow and i was doing a bit of that too, I was lucky that i got a job offer during my college campus for a web dev job at Hyderabad. Hence I shifted there and started pursuing that job and i am still pursuing this job."

I dont know what will be happening in future but i will be setteling with lower level and that is a decision i have made with a week of self realisation."
