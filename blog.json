During the first 2 years I was into lower level coding and was officially maintaining Android projects mainly Custom Android sources like DotOS, SuperiorOS, Liquid Remix, ViperOS, then as my interest shifted I got introduced to web development from various subreddits i used to follow and i was doing a bit of that too, I was lucky that i got a job offer during my college campus for a web dev job at Hyderabad. Hence I shifted there and started pursuing that job and i am still pursuing this job."

      "full": "Now that i am in web dev, I feel I should be gravitating towards lower level coding like i used to but this time it won't be saggregated and I would be making it count and will be working in a 'brick by brick' method where now i am starting to refocus my attention on c++ and c along with all the GATE Topics of CS to solidify my confidence in CS and all of its subject, as pure CS is mostly lower level, I feel I can do something nice in this field including research and i think thats where my core interest lies on, even though web is nice and all but I feel right at home doing lower level coding as it ties me close to computer science. I dont know what will be happening in future but i will be setteling with lower level and that is a decision i have made with a week of self realisation."
